# Parallel_Stocks

This project aims to predict the stocks in the future using support vector machines and comparing with an ANN in serial and parallel computing. It aims to disagree with the Effective Market Hypothesis(EMH) which states that you cannot predict a stock in the future.

It also aims to check the time complexity of not only between algorithms but also comparing the same algorithm between serial and parallel computing to see if parallel computing is worth in such a situation.
